## How to Run the Current Implementation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 8+
- Docker and Docker Compose v2
- PostgreSQL client (optional)

### Quick Start

```bash

cd customer-nexus-hub
docker compose up -d

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Setup environment
cd packages/backend
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Run database migrations (when TypeORM migrations are set up)
# pnpm typeorm migration:run
